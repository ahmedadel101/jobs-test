      <h3>Job Description</h3>
      <p>Learn one way to build applications with Angular and reuse your code and abilities to build
        apps for any deployment target. For web, mobile web, native mobile and native desktop.</p>

      <p>Achieve the maximum speed possible on the Web Platform today, and take it further, via Web
        Workers and server-side rendering. Angular puts you in control over scalability. Meet huge
        data requirements by building data models on RxJS, Immutable.js or another push-model.</p>

      <p>Build features quickly with simple, declarative templates. Extend the template language with
        your own components and use a wide array of existing components. Get immediate Angular-specific
        help and feedback with nearly every IDE and editor. All this comes together so you can focus
        on building amazing apps rather than trying to make the code work.</p>

      <p>From prototype through global deployment, Angular delivers the productivity and scalable
        infrastructure that supports Google's largest applications.</p>


      <p>Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web. Angular
        combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated
        best practices to solve development challenges. Angular empowers developers to build
        applications that live on the web, mobile, or the desktop</p>
